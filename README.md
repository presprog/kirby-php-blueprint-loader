# Kirby PHP Blueprint Loader Plugin

Start using PHP blueprints in your `site` folder today!

> ⚡ Ready for Kirby 4!

----

## 🚀 How to use

Kirby lets you use PHP-based blueprints in plugins, e.g. to use different blueprints for different user roles. This is thoroughly described [in Sonja's fantastic cook book article](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/development-deployment/programmable-blueprints). Unfortunately, this does not work with the native `blueprints` folder, usually residing in `site/blueprints`.

After installing this plugin, you can start using PHP-based blueprints in `site/blueprints` folder, just like you would in plugins!

Happy Coding!
